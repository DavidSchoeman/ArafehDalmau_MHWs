# ArafehDalmau_MHWs
Analysis of marine heatwaves for Arafeh-Dalmau et al. (2023) One Earth.

# Caveats and Dependencies
This code is provided "as is" it runs start-to-end on my machine, but I cannot guarantee the same for others, as I have not tested it in an external environment.
Much of the code requires system calls to CDO (Climate Data Operators), described here: https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki. These system calls work well on MacOS, but I have not tested them in the Windows environment.

# Original data sources
OISST data were downloaded from NASA: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html
CMIP6 sea-surface temperature projections were downloaded in 2020/2021 from the ESGF website: https://aims2.llnl.gov/search 

# Notes on code development
Code was developed over the period 2020â€“2023. Some packages might now be deprecated or are nearing deprecation (e.g., raster). As a result, I have subsequently improved some workflows for a follow-on paper and I will update this repo with that improved code once that paper is published.

# How to use the code
To build the required datasets, it is necessary to pre-process OISST and CMIP6 data. After downloading the requisite data (links above), the user should run the code chunks sequentially from "1_tos_Regrid_Anom" to "10_Stack_Rasters.R". Each code chunk should produce output (files written to disk) that is used as input in the subsequent chunk(s).

Note that the folders/directories named in this code pertain to my own setup, and these paths will need to be edited to suit the user's own machine.

Code chunks "11_Compute_MHW_CumInt_2014_2015.R" and "12_Projected_MHW_Nur.R" use the pre-processed data to extract the observed and projected MHW stats used in this analysis.

Note that data produced using this code is archived in the data folder of the associated GitHub repo for this project at: https://github.com/jcvdav/recovery_time

# Fair warning about computing resources
Raw and processed data files (mainly in netCDF format) require several terrabytes of storage space. Some routines are also memory intensive, so adjustments to arguments might be needed in the calls to set up parallel processes. Finally, depending on processor speed and number of ESMs/scenarios considered, this workflow can take weeks to many weeks to run. Do not attempt the workflow before provisioning your machine accordingly.
